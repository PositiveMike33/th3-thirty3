      "content": "OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources. These sources include websites, social media, public records, news articles, academic publications, and more. OSINT is used by intelligence agencies, law enforcement, cybersecurity professionals, journalists, and researchers.\n\nThe OSINT cycle consists of 5 phases:\n1. Planning and Direction - Define objectives and requirements\n2. Collection - Gather information from open sources\n3. Processing - Organize and format collected data\n4. Analysis - Evaluate and interpret the information\n5. Dissemination - Share findings with stakeholders",

This information can reveal:\n- Social media presence\n- Professional profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub)\n- Forum memberships\n- Dating profiles\n- Gaming accounts\n\nBest practices:\n1. Always verify findings manually\n2. Consider username variations\n3. Cross-reference with other tools\n4. Document all findings",

Profile analysis - Bio, posts, connections\n2. Network mapping - Who they interact with\n3. Geolocation - Location from posts/photos\n4. Temporal analysis - Activity patterns\n5. Sentiment analysis - Opinions and attitudes\n6. EXIF data extraction from images\n\nEthical considerations:\n- Respect privacy settings\n- Don't create fake accounts\n- Document your methodology\n- Stay within legal boundaries",
